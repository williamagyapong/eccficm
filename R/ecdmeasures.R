#' ecdmeasures: A package for computing new distance correlation/covariance
#' measures for testing independence between two random vectors.
#'
#' The ecdmeasures package provides three main functions:
#' ecd, ecdcor and ecdcov.test
#'
#' @section ecdmeasures functions:
#' The ecd function computes the distance covariance and distance correlation type of measures
#'
#' The ecdcor.test function performs a permutation test of independence based on
#' the distance correlation type of measure
#'
#' The ecdcov.test function performs a permutation test of independence based on
#' the distance covariance type of measure
